  <ul id="interests">
      <li id ="firstone">Programming</li>
      <p id="interests">Having just started serious programming dring my freshman year of college,
      I'm most fluent in Java. However, I've also dabbled with, and have beginner level
      understandings of Python, Javascript, PHP, and Go.


      <li id ="firstone">Computer Hardware</li>
      <p id="interests">I decided in my freshman year of high school that the challenge of building my
        own custom computer would probably be something that I'd very much enjoy. Even though
        it took me almost three years to complete the build, I loved every second of it. From
        that point on I've been intrigued by the not only the basic functions of CPUs, GPUs, RAM,
        and so forth, but also by concepts in computer engineering like Moore's Law, hashing, and
        bit flipping.

      <li id ="firstone">News/Information</li>
      <p id="interests">Far from being what's known as a news junkie, I suppose a more apt term for me would
          be info glutton. I don't like to stop at just the news for my daily dose of current
          events. Anything from tech sites to forum discussions to economics blogs all fuel my
          thirst for information. Among the major publications that I read are the New York Times,
          the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Forbes, Business Insider, the Associated
          Press, and Arstechnica.

      <li id ="firstone">Gaming</li>
      <p id="interests">It's my firm belief that every computer scientist should be a gamer in some way. Whether
            it's all the latest and greatest consoles and newly released games, or timeless classics
            for the Commodore 64 or original Atari, everyone has a gamer inside of them. Personally,
            I opt for the best of both worlds, playing games like Mario 64 and Super Smash Bros on
            the NES, and using a current generation Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for newer titles
            like Dead Rising 4, The Division, and Death Stranding.
