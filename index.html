    <h1>The Beginning</h1>
    <p>What to say about me...It's been an interesting ride. I got a job at a grocery store,
      right out of college. Just for a way to make money. Here I am, 40 years later,
      completely unemployed. Oh, I've been around the world. You know, here and there.
      You know? Grenada, for a while. Then Panama, then Afghanistan. Never joined the
      military though. Still lived a fulfilling life.</p>
